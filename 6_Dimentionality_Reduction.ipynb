        "   * Example: A high temperature of 35°C is normal in summer but abnormal in winter.\n",

        "### 🔹 **Statistical Methods**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Assume data follows a distribution (e.g., Gaussian).\n",
        "* Flag points far from mean (using **z-scores** or thresholds).\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🔹 **Distance-Based Methods**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Points far from others are anomalies.\n",
        "* Example: **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)** anomaly detection.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🔹 **Density-Based Methods**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Points in low-density regions are anomalies.\n",
        "* Example: **DBSCAN**, **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🔹 **Clustering-Based**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Normal data forms clusters; anomalies don’t belong to any cluster.\n",
        "* Example: K-Means anomaly detection.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🔹 **Machine Learning Methods**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **One-Class SVM:** Learns a boundary around normal data, flags points outside.\n",
        "* **Isolation Forest:** Randomly splits data; anomalies are easier to isolate.\n",
        "* **Autoencoders (Deep Learning):** Reconstruct input data; anomalies have high reconstruction error.\n",
